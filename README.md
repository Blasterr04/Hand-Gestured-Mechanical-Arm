The "Hand Gesture Controlled Mechanical Arm" project involves creating a robotic arm that replicates human hand movements via hand gestures. Key components include flex sensors, servo motors, an Arduino UNO board, and an ESP32 microcontroller. The construction process involves designing the arm using SolidWorks, 3D printing, and assembling the glove with flex sensors. The system works by transmitting finger movement data from the glove to the robotic arm, enabling precise control of the arm's movements. Applications span manufacturing automation, rehabilitation, and education. Challenges faced included manufacturing adjustments, data transmission issues, and sensor sensitivity management. The project successfully integrated various technologies to achieve an intuitive control mechanism for robotic applications.
